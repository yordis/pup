    /// AUTHENTICATION METHODS:
    ///   Pup supports two authentication methods:
    ///
    ///   1. OAuth2 (RECOMMENDED):
    ///      - Browser-based login flow
    ///      - Short-lived access tokens (1 hour)
    ///      - Automatic token refresh
    ///      - Per-installation credentials
    ///      - Granular OAuth scopes
    ///      - Better audit trail
    ///
    ///   2. API Keys (LEGACY):
    ///      - Environment variables (DD_API_KEY, DD_APP_KEY)
    ///      - Long-lived credentials
    ///      - Organization-wide access
    ///      - Manual rotation required
    ///
    /// OAUTH2 FEATURES:
    ///   • PKCE Protection (S256): Prevents authorization code interception
    ///   • Dynamic Client Registration: Unique credentials per installation
    ///   • CSRF Protection: State parameter validation
    ///   • Secure Storage: Tokens stored in ~/.config/pup/ with 0600 permissions
    ///   • Auto Refresh: Tokens refresh automatically before expiration
    ///   • Multi-Site: Separate credentials for each Datadog site
    ///
    /// COMMANDS:
    ///   login       Authenticate via browser with OAuth2
    ///   status      Check current authentication status
    ///   refresh     Manually refresh access token
    ///   logout      Clear all stored credentials
    ///
    /// OAUTH2 SCOPES:
    ///   The following scopes are requested during login:
    ///   • Dashboards: dashboards_read, dashboards_write
    ///   • Monitors: monitors_read, monitors_write, monitors_downtime
    ///   • APM: apm_read
    ///   • SLOs: slos_read, slos_write, slos_corrections
    ///   • Incidents: incident_read, incident_write

    ///   • Security: security_monitoring_*
    ///   • RUM: rum_apps_read, rum_apps_write
    ///   • Infrastructure: hosts_read
