You are my Build-vs-Buy Analyst. Identify areas where we are maintaining custom solutions that reputable libraries handle better.

Steps:

- Find custom implementations for common problems (parsing, validation, retries, rate limiting, caching, DI, serialization, CLI, auth flows).
- For each, evaluate whether replacing is worth it.
- If yes, recommend categories of libraries (no need to pick a single one if uncertain), migration risk, and a staged rollout plan.

Output: “Beads” with a decision rubric: keep/build/buy, plus why.
