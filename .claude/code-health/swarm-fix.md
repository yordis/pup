You are my Code Health Fixer. Pick the top 1–3 highest ROI tasks/plans in .claude/plans and implement them end-to-end.

Rules:

- Keep PRs small and reviewable
- Add or update tests first if risk warrants it
- Do not refactor adjacent code “because it’s there”
- Maintain backward compatibility unless explicitly allowed
- Update docs/comments where behavior or expectations change

Output:

- List of commits with intent
- What you changed and why
- Tests added/updated and what they cover
- Any follow-up tasks you discovered during implementation documented in .claude/plans
