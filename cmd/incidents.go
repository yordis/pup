	Use:   "incidents",
	Short: "Manage incidents",
	Long: `Manage Datadog incidents for incident response and tracking.

Incidents provide a centralized place to track, communicate, and resolve issues
affecting your services. They integrate with monitors, timelines, tasks, and
postmortems.

CAPABILITIES:
  • List all incidents with filtering and pagination
  • Get detailed incident information including timeline, tasks, and attachments
  • View incident severity, status, and customer impact
  • Track incident response and resolution

INCIDENT SEVERITIES:
  • SEV-1: Critical impact - complete service outage
  • SEV-2: High impact - major functionality unavailable
  • SEV-3: Moderate impact - partial functionality affected
  • SEV-4: Low impact - minor issues
  • SEV-5: Minimal impact - cosmetic issues

INCIDENT STATES:
  • active: Incident is ongoing, actively being worked
  • stable: Incident is under control but not fully resolved
  • resolved: Incident has been resolved
  • completed: Post-incident tasks completed (postmortem, etc.)

EXAMPLES:
  # List all incidents
  pup incidents list

  # Get detailed incident information
  pup incidents get abc-123-def

  # Get incident and view timeline
  pup incidents get abc-123-def | jq '.data.timeline'

  # Check incident status
  pup incidents get abc-123-def | jq '{status: .data.status, severity: .data.severity}'

INCIDENT FIELDS:
  • id: Incident ID
  • title: Incident title
  • description: Detailed description
  • severity: Severity level (SEV-1 through SEV-5)
  • state: Incident state (active, stable, resolved, completed)
  • customer_impacted: Whether customers are affected
  • customer_impact_scope: Description of customer impact
  • detected_at: When incident was detected
  • created_at: When incident was created in Datadog
  • resolved_at: When incident was resolved

  • responders: Team members responding
  • attachments: Related documents, runbooks, etc.

AUTHENTICATION:
  Requires either OAuth2 authentication (pup auth login) or API keys
  (DD_API_KEY and DD_APP_KEY environment variables).`,

  # List incidents with table output
  pup incidents list --output=table

  # Save incidents to file
  pup incidents list > incidents.json

  # Filter active incidents with jq
  pup incidents list | jq '.data[] | select(.state == "active")'

  # Find SEV-1 incidents
  pup incidents list | jq '.data[] | select(.severity == "SEV-1")'

  # Find customer-impacting incidents
  pup incidents list | jq '.data[] | select(.customer_impacted == true)'

OUTPUT FIELDS:
  • id: Incident ID
  • title: Incident title
  • description: Incident description

  • By severity: pup incidents list | jq '.data[] | select(.severity == "SEV-1")'
  • Customer impact: pup incidents list | jq '.data[] | select(.customer_impacted)'
  • Recent: pup incidents list | jq '.data[] | select(.created_at > "2024-01-01")'

SORTING:
  Incidents are returned sorted by creation time (most recent first).`,
